# Codex provider

Codex supports structured plan requests, editing and rerunning eligible messages,
and compaction through the thread’s supported controls. Inspect the thread with
`zcc thread show <id> --json` before recovery actions, and use `zcc guide threads`
for the commands available in this build. Clearing a durable active Goal requires
provider confirmation.

Unlisted model IDs are accepted by this provider; acceptance does not establish
account access. Select the actual execution machine in the thread composer when
inspecting its model catalog. `zcc machine provider-cli status <host-id> --json`
checks the host’s installed provider CLIs.

Use the core CLI skill for command syntax and official Codex guidance for
upstream product behavior.
